My first introduction to wearables was in my interactive media workshop's first semester module. At the time, I didn't think to much about it. My notion of the concept generated after attending a lecture on the subject from that course was that it was uninteresting. My conclusion was formulated on the ignorance that wearables simply referred to gadgets like apple watches that were created by big tech and used to replace accessories like glasses and wristwatches. The lecture had more information that should have got me to think outside the box. I just, for lack of better understanding, went away with the notion that I did.

Fast forward to 2021, at the early moments of the semester where classes are just beginning, I was attending a seminar/workshop in my main interactive media module. Our professor, Dr. Gabriela Avram has us populating a mural board with concepts and topics (kind of like tags) that have to with our are area. ( I will have to come back to this in another blog post.) But she has to leave to attend another seminar about about wearables which she invites those interested in to join in on. 

Being the curious person that I am, I join in on the seminar. It's a conglomeration of design academics in the HCI field. I've always wanted to be in these sort of group seminars of creative thinkers. Creativity in general fills me up with excitement, especially screen based art and design. This was of course non screen based but it was still fascinating. The discussion was about: 

Deformable, shape-changing and wearable devices for the workplace. ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-pBXKuMzkM&ab_channel=WellesleyHCILab))

I joined in late but what I was witnessed when I joined was pure alien and I liked it. At the point I joined they were talking about embedding speakers in clothes. The concept raised so many question in my mind and I wasn't able to comprehend what they were talking about until revisiting the recording. The biggest questions on my mind could be summarized as: 'why?'. 

Maybe the answer to that question is 'why not?'. A valuable lesson when considering design is to not limit yourself when exploring. Wearbles, while not a new concept, has an opportunity for a lot of innovative ideas. Human issues are as many as the stars, it only makes sense that we create an equal amount of opportunities to solve them. 

A few weeks later, Dr. Gabriela Avram gave a seminar about wearables. She started off by explaning what the term 'wearables' covers and gave examples such as the smart watches and clothings that have been modified with tech. She also mentioned other things that caught my attention like 'ingestables', 'tatoos', . My enthusiasm meter pushed max and my mind started doing that thing computers do when the cpu is overloaded. I was excited because of how little how knew about this area. The less I know about a creative area, the more excited I am about it because it means my mind has a lot of ideas to explore. 

The concept of cyborgs was brought up which I was familiar with thanks to hollywood. Dr. Avram spoke about this to point out the direction in which wearable could see itself in the near future. With things like implants, tatoos and glasses, my mind turned to the popular videogame cyberpunk. I haven't had time to play the game, but a lot of the themes in this game relate to the idea of wearables. I think kind of gives 

In the seminar we got a hands on experience on creating wearables. Prior to the seminar, Dr. Avram had sent us packages which she meticulously put together. The package came in the form of a small envlope with very interesting stickers on the cover. In the session we followed a tutorial she had created for an interactive light switch. It was created using the contents of the package. There was conductive thread...yes conductive thread. This was the first time i had heard of such of a thing. So we sewed the conductive thread around a pouch that would later be used to house a battery. Then we sewed a circuit connecting an led to the battery pouch on the a clothing materia. The experience was grand to say the least. 

Working with wearables introduced me to a new avenue for creativity. It was exciting and fun. I think that in my thesis I could definitely think about use cases for wearables. I'll have to see about.
