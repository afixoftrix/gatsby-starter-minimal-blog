When I first spoke with the course leader for the Interaction and experience design master's back in 2017, I was in the infant stage of a career as a web developer. Back then what mattered to me was exploring ways I could be creative with code. I thought the course would allow me to be more creative with coding. It turns out that I missed the mark slightly and that the art and technology master's program might have been a better fit for what I was thinking. But as I continued in my career, due to deferring my position in the master's program, I became more exposed to the world and workings of the software industry. I had always been interested in 3d. I had tried to teach myself cinema4d back in highschool but didnt get far. For web development, animations and 3d was what made websites look cool. And that's what I'm about for the most part creating or consuming cool visuals.

Fastfoward a few years, I'm in Ireland preparing for the second semester of the master's I defered all those years ago. The course instructor holds a meeting where we talk about our first assignment which is to write a proposal for what we want our thesis to be about. During the meeting he asks if anyone wants to share what they were thinking about doing. Me being a usual responder in online meetings, I respond with something along the lines of "I want to create something with ar/vr". Everything I had learned about in the first semester about human-centered design and not starting off with technology first was completely oblivious to me. I was still very much the software engineer and not a designer. But this was a turning point for me- it was the first time I realized that I could no longer be just an engineer seeking to scratch my creative itch (atleast in this course).

For the proposal, we were urged to look at the UN sustainable development goals when thinking about our research topic. I actually began to think about our responsibility to humanity as designers while looking at the goals. To make a choice, I wanted to find a goal where I could truly explore my creativity, one where I could let my imagination run wild. The choice I ended up with was goal 14, *Life Under Water*. Below is the proposal I wrote to my course instructor:

### To the waters we turn

*A thesis proposal*

"There’s nothing wrong with enjoying looking at the surface of the ocean itself, except that when you finally see what goes on underwater, you realize that you’ve been missing the whole point of the ocean. Staying on the surface all the time is like going to the circus and staring at the outside of the tent." - Dave Barry

I would like to explore and research the areas relating to life below the waters. The ocean is still a mystery to a lot of land-dwellers even though their lives are directly impacted by these mysterious large bodies of water. From its ecological foot print, to the world economics, the ocean has a big part to play in our daily lives yet it is largely unexplored and is, instead, used as a dumping ground. My interest is in exploring the oceanic ecosystem and finding ways to help improve marine life, promote knowledge and inspire positive interaction with the bodies of water around us. While not set in stone yet, I am currently looking at ways to connect “blue-green” ocean farmers to the regular man. Whatever the direction I go in, it would be to help build a better ecosystem through interactive media.

There are multiple modes of research and data collection that  I would like carry out while pursuing my aim. At the core, my research should do two things —first, explore the dialog between everyday humans and people who have occupations that have to do with marine life, secondly, explore general human interaction with the sea. Ethnography of fishermen, probing of the average human, and reading of scholarly works are just some of the possible ways I plan to explore this field. By doing this, I am able to sift out issues where I believe I can apply human-centered interactive media design to help. I hope to have a solid lead on the issue that I want to solve by the end of February.

As the initial quote indicates, there is a lot to explore in the ocean. Drawing the attention of land-dwellers to the importance of the ocean invigorates the drive to a healthier ocean and greener ecosystem. As I take on the mantle of “designer”, I have come to see that there’s a bigger picture to consider when building for humans which is building with the earth in mind. The designs that are created not only need to be human-centered, they must also be sustainable and environment friendly. My are of research is taken from the list of UN goals (14 - Life Below Water). By working in this area, I believe that I can come up with solutions that help both humans and the earth.

In conclusion, I would like to suggest that whoever is interested or knowledgable in this area be my advisor. Since this is going to be a research heavy endeavor, I would prefer it to be Dr. Cristiano Storni. I think the technical parts come easier for me than the research. I am also taking technical courses this semester.
