This is the second blog in project Inumbra. A project initated while working on a prototype for my Interaction and Experience Design workshop module.

So these are just a few things are learned/discovered in my second week of fiddling with React Native. I was having issues running the android emulator using Expo but have now figured it out.

The first error that I go was telling me that I didn't have an android phone connected or an emulator working. I opened an emulator but then another problem showed up. So to avoid anymore mistakes I learned from my first experience where I couldnt get react-native to build properly using the `react-native-cli` and I went to the expo documentation and looked up what I needed to do to get the android simulator working. The documentation had a list of things to do to get adb working.

I also learned how to use Chrome to debug mobile app using expo.

When there is a bug in the code and you run your application in the simulator or phone through expo, you'll see the error message on the screen. A useful way to debug this is through chrome.
