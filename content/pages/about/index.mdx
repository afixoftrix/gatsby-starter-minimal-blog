Hi!

I'm Unwana Essien, a multidisciplinary designer and engineer. My passion lies in computer-aided design and creativity. 

I'm currently at the University of Limerick working on my master's thesis in interaction and experience design. When I'm not doing that, I am exploring the world computer generated art or photography.
